I adore collaborative writing and coding!
Please feel encouraged to give me a poetry assignment (examples: "Sestina for "FDR", "Pantoum containing the phrase ''queeling like a pig'.")
or share a poem or prose you would like collaborate on.
I am also avaliable for hire as an editor though I highly suggest we collaborate first to make sure we are a good fit.  
The relationship between writer and editor is sacred and should not be entered blindly. 
I understand deadlines so you may request a resume at cessnaurina@gmail.com if you need editing done quickly.
I program in swift mostly but have dabled in many other languages and would love to brush up on projects not in swift.
